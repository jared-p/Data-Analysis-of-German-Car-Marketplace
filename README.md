## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The automobile marketplace is a complex space, vehicles are intricate and contain many properties that must be considered when purchasing. Ultamately, however, the most important attribute of a vehicle is the price; which gives rise to a natural question: what attribute has the greatest influence on a vehicles price? What are the weighting factors on each of the attributes of a vehicle, for instance: can a large amount of horsepower overcome high milage? Knowing what attributes of a vehicle affect its price the most gives sellers the power to appropriatly price their vehicle, and gives buyers the power to make a fair offer on a vehicle. A stength of this data set is how easily it can be translated to a user-facing dashboard. The analyzed data could be translated to a dashboard that could reflect car prices with the factored properties taken into account. Alternatively, a vehicle could be entered and the dashboard could analyze the input to recomend a price given the specifications using a model found for the weighting factors.

The data is provided by Kaggle user Ander, accessible through: https://www.kaggle.com/ander289386/cars-germany. The data is automatically scraped from popular German car marketplace AutoScout24. The data set reflects all cars listed on the website that were for sale in the German marketplace from 2011 through 2021. Each tuple of the data tells the car make, model, milage, fuel type, transmission, condition, price, horsepower, and year. The data set was originally collected to illustrate Ander's website data scraping software Zenrows.com, thus the data set is a faux advertisement.

I am an electrical engineering student, I have the slightest passion about vehicles. I am looking forward to learning about important vehicle price factors.
